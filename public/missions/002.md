# Mission // #002
## alyriana_01.exe

The 'resident' NHP on-base has offered a series of simulated combat exercises to the Lancer pilots. While this first 'mission' is simply a calibration test of sorts, Alyriana has noted that future simulation successes may be rewarded with License Levels.

# Goals
- Destroy all enemy mechs.

# Stakes
- None.
  -  This isn't entirely true - many of the colonists watched the Lancer's tournament on the Onminet, and the entire base is abuzz with excitement to see them in more difficult scenarios.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
