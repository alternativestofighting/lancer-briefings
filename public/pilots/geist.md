## Biography

Dr. Estelmist was one of the pioneers of NHP development in the early days of the field. As humanity was realizing the gulf between how these new entities perceived the world around them and how humans did, Simone was only imagining the possibilities. Reversal of causation? Parallel reality branch selection? Dissipation into the omni-net? These so-called 'problems' only intrigued Dr. Estelmist. As she helped build, train, and develop early NHP entities from COMP/CON to ATHENA, she dreamed of her human limits being shattered as humans and NHPs learned from each other.

As the dangers of RA were revealed, the research and development of NHP technology was changed accordingly. Dr. Estelmist's efforts started to become labeled as "problematic", "potentially hazardous", and "simply unethical"--all cowardly cries of those who cannot see past their own horizons. When Union security came to confiscate her materials and end her research, Simone collected her most precious "specimens", escaped from her laboratory on Cradle, hijacked a jumpship, and disappeared past the Diaspora--and time itself.

After... months? Years? Centuries? Who knows... Dr. Simone Estelmist returned from her light-speed journey across the galaxy. The world she returned to was different in many ways, but the same in too many others. Simone was surprised to see NHPs being used 'in the wild'--especially in combat scenarios aboard Lancer mechs. In order to forge a new identity (for cover) and provide plausible deniability to her interaction with NHPs again, Dr. Estelmist enrolled in the Lancer Pilot Academy.

## Appearance

Dr. Estelmist's age is... complicated. Physically, she is... probably... in her early thirties. She stopped counting years during her time spent alone at light-speed. In the context of reality, though, she is likely over a thousand years 'old'.

Most would describe Simone's appearance as... off-putting. She has countless cybernetic implants, subdermal dataplating, and subjectivity enhancement augmentations. She usually has projected energy displays around her, and she wears strange mixtures of bio-mesh sylph suits, electronic cabling, and thermo-weave 'coverings'. She tends not to 'talk' but instead plays her subvocal communications over self-installed speaker systems if she cares for nearby entities to hear her. Otherwise, Dr. Estelmist lives more in the digital and conceptual realms than the reality she shares with others.

## Trivia

* Dr. Estelmist's current NHP project is a 'fork' of the now-ubiquitous ATHENA-class NHP series that she helped design in her youth. Originally tested under the simple moniker "BEETLE", as the entity has started to develop and 'person'-alize, she has tentatively given it the "HYPNOS-class" designation. It has evolved complex thought, combat acumen, and computational proficiency, but its individuality and 'personality' are still nascent.
* A distressing percentage of Simone's internal organs have been 'modified' cybernetically, some when she was still a young scientists and others by her own hand during her deep-space voyage. She now has more 'improvements' than even she can remember, from sub-cutaneous dataplugs and subjectivity-sync suites to internalized holo-projectors and speaker systems.
* Though Simone doesn't have strong preferences when it comes to flavorful foods and drinks, she does have a soft spot for hot teas and soups. One sure-fire way to melt her icy demeanor is to offer her a piping-hot cup of pu-erh with a few drops of local-planet honey.
